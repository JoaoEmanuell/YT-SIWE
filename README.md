# YT-SIWE
YouTube Shorts In Watch Extension (SIWE) is an extension to open videos in short format like a video in normal format

# Getting Started

This extension uses typescript and is packaged with webpack.

## Installations

Install the necessary packages for operation:

    npm install

## Scripts

Inside *package.json* in the scripts area you can see that there are two scripts, called **start** and **build**.

You can read the scripts description or click [here](#build) to learn how to build the extension.

### Start

Start calls the typescript compiler to compile the files to javascript.

### Build

Build calls webpack to compress the javascript files generated by the typescript and save them as a single file called *index.js* inside *./siwe/extension/dist*.

This way the files are merged into one, making the extension lighter and avoiding having to add several files to the *manifest* in addition to avoiding *imports* erros.

## Build

If you are using *tsc --watch* to compile the files, you can just use *npm run build* to do the build.

If I wanted to run both (start and build) I recommend installing *npm-run-all* as global, it will allow the execution of more than one script, thus saving a little time.

Install it:

    npm install npm-run-all -g

Executing:

    npm-run-all start build

That way it will compile to javascript and do the build.
